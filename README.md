# Design Teardown

Practice breaking down the design of [Smashing Magazine's homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/). The darkness of the containers is meant to show where the eye is drawn to on the page. This exercise is apart of [this lesson from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown).
